# InvisibleCloak

🌟 Creating an Invisible Cloak using OpenCV

Hey everyone! 👋 I've been working on a fun project using Python and OpenCV to create an "Invisible Cloak" effect just like in Harry Potter! 🧙‍♂️

How it works:
Objective: Make any object covered in a specific color appear invisible on screen.
Tools: Python, OpenCV, numpy, matplotlib.
Key Steps:
Capture Video: Utilize OpenCV to capture video from your webcam.
Set Up Background: Capture a frame to use as the background without the object you want to cloak.
Color Detection: Convert frames to HSV color space and use a predefined color range to detect the cloak color.
Masking: Create a mask to separate the cloak from the rest of the frame.
Create Final Frame: Combine the masked cloak with the background to create the illusion of invisibility.
Display: Continuously display the resulting frames in a named window.
